# Flipkart Automation using Selenium and Eclipse IDE


## Overview
This Selenium automation script fetches Samsung Galaxy S10 products on the Flipkart website, applies filters, and retrieves product details such as names and prices. This is just a basic test automation code and can be modified as per needs.

## Prerequisites
- Latest Java Development Kit (JDK) 
- Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE) installed
- Chrome browser installed
- WebDriver for Chrome configured in the project
  (You can perform the automation on any browser, just have the webdriver installed for that browser and modift the code as per the browser)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
3. Ensure the WebDriver for Chrome is correctly configured in the project.
4. Run the `testcode.java` file to execute the automation script.

## Code Description
- The script uses Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the Flipkart website.
- It navigates to Flipkart, searches for "Samsung Galaxy S10" in the mobiles section, applies filters and sorts the products by price.
- Product names from the first page and prices are fetched and printed on the console.

## Usage
- Execute the script to fetch Samsung Galaxy S10 products on Flipkart.
- Review the console output to see the list of products and their prices.

## Troubleshooting
- If there are issues with WebDriver configuration, update the WebDriver path in the code.
- Ensure a stable internet connection for web interactions.
- Remember to create a Java project in the Selenium IDE with pom.xml file with required dependancies
